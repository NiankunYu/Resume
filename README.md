# Resume
I am a postdoctoral fellow at the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC). I get my bachelor degree in Physics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and my PhD degree in astronomy from Peking University (PKU). My PhD supervisors are Luis C. Ho and Jing Wang.

My research interests lie in the baryon cycle and multi-phase ISM, which encompasses the conversion of atomic to molecular gas and subsequent star formation. I have acquired considerable experience in data processing as a member of the CRAFTS and WALLABY surveys.
